  <h3>What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>I had no knowledge of any scripting/coding language so this was the first class where I ever experienced this kind of field of work.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch and why?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>I used a templete for my portfolio from SimpleTempletes, I felt like using a templete was a fast and easy set up so I was able to use all my focus towards coding and designing my portfoilo to make it look nice and solve any problems that might've popped up.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The most challenging part of my portfolio was formating and desiging so it'll fit my liking as I am very picky about my work so everything had to be nice looking and precise and whenever it didn't look the way I wanted it too ti was very fustrating to learn how to solve that problemm.. </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>How did the class change your view on Web Development?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>This class opened my eyes to Web development, I never really actually knew what Web Development was until I took this class so my views on this subject was okay, it was definitely a lot more work than I realized and its just something I not that much interested in.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>I would recommend taking this class to people who are interested in or wanting to see how Web development as it was very informative to learn about this field but should be prepared to self-study and use a lot of their resources for this class.</li>
  </ul>
